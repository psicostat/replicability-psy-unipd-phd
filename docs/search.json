For the school the three main chapters are the 1, 3 and 4.\nWe highly suggest to read the chapters in advance preparing some questions, critiques, comments related to the chapters content and how the concept of replicability applies to your research. There will be space for group discussion thus be prepared! :)\n\n\n\nIn terms of software, we will mainly use R thus if you want to follow the lectures code and try also by yourself you need to install R and highly suggested an R IDE such as Posit, Positron or VScode.\nAll the materials are mainly written in Quarto. If you want to reproduce them you need to install Quarto. Quarto will be covered in the pre-school workshop by Margherita Calderan.\nIn terms of R packages, the README of the book contains more details about which packages to install.\n\n\n\nThe book is a work-in-progress project thus we highly appreciate feedbacks, comments, etc. You can put (public) comments using the free tool hypothesis.is (see below)."

    "section": "",
    "text": "When evaluating the reliability of scientific findings and predictions, a major concern is about their replicability, that is their consistency across different studies aimed at answering the same question. A “replicability crisis” has been claimed in the last decades, denouncing that a large part of published research findings, especially in applied sciences, such as psychology or medicine failed to be confirmed by subsequent studies. Difficulties in moving from empirical evidence and data analysis to a scientific result push towards the need to clarify various aspects, such as rigorous definitions, the possible tools for understanding and communicating the uncertainty inherent in most scientific conclusions, the definition of non-questionable research practices. The main objective of the course is to provide a broad and interdisciplinary view, as well as the tools that may enable individual participants to focus on specific aspects of replicability that are relevant to their own discipline of interest. The epistemological, philosophical and scientific/statistical bases of replicability and of its so-called crisis will be addressed in lectures by the teachers. Guided group activities will then be proposed to the students, to discuss basic questions and apply the ideas emerged during the course to some real data analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProf. Branden Fitelson  Northeastern University, USA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProf. Giovanni Parmigiani  Harvard University, USA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Filippo Gambarota  University of Padova, Italy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the detailed program here.\n\n\n\n\nDepartment of Statistical Sciences, University of Padova\nPhD Course in Psychological Sciences, University of Padova\n\n\n\n\nProf. Emanuele Aliverti, Department of Statistical Sciences\nProf. Gianmarco Altoè, Department of Developmental Psychology and Socialization\nDr. Margherita Calderan, Department of General Psychology\nDr. Filippo Gambarota, Department of Developmental Psychology and Socialization\nProf. Bruno Scarpa, Department of Statistical Sciences"
