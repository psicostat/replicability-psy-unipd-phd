The epistemological, philosophical and scientific/statistical bases of replicability and of its so-called crisis will be addressed in lectures by the teachers. Guided group activities will then be proposed to the students, to discuss basic questions and apply the ideas emerged during the course to some real data analysis.\n\n## Lecturers\n\n::: {layout-ncol=3}\n\n![Prof. [Branden Fitelson](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/faculty/branden-fitelson/) </br> Northeastern University, USA](files/fitelson.png){width=90%}\n\n![Prof. [Giovanni Parmigiani](https://scholar.harvard.edu/parmigiani) </br> Harvard University, USA](files/parmigiani.jpg){width=90%}\n\n![Dr. [Filippo Gambarota](https://filippogambarota.github.io) </br> University of Padova, Italy](files/gambarota.png){width=90%}\n\n:::\n\n## Program\n\nA more detailed program will be available soon. <!-- TODO update -->\n\n| **Day**    | **Hour**      | **Room** |\n|------------|---------------|----------|\n| 09/06/2025 | 09:00 - 17:00 | TBD      |\n| 10/06/2025 | 09:00 - 17:00 | TBD      |\n| 11/06/2025 | 09:00 - 17:00 | TDB      |\n\nThe school will take place at the [School of Psychology](https://www.psicologia.unipd.it/en/), Via Venezia, 12, 35131 Padova PD (University of Padova).\n\n<center>\n<iframe width=\"425\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/export/embed.html?bbox=11.8908628821373%2C45.41036482025023%2C11.895342171192171%2C45.41200675122365&amp;layer=mapnik\" style=\"border: 1px solid black\"></iframe><br/><small><a href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/?#map=19/45.411186/11.893103\">View Larger Map</a></small>\n</center>\n\n## Organizers\n\n- [Department of Statistical Sciences](https://www.stat.unipd.it/), University of Padova\n- PhD Course in [Psychological Sciences](https://dottorato.psy.unipd.it/en), University of Padova\n\n### Organizing committee\n\n- Prof. [Emanuele Aliverti](https://emanuelealiverti.github.io/), Department of Statistical Sciences\n- Prof. [Gianmarco Altoè](https://www.unipd.it/en/contatti/rubrica/?detail=Y&ruolo=1&checkout=cerca&persona=ALTOE%27&key=6A8AF57C3282433554D456917489A756), Department of Developmental Psychology and Socialization\n- Dr. [Margherita Calderan](https://dpg.unipd.it/calderan-margherita), Department of General Psychology\n- Dr. [Filippo Gambarota](https://filippogambarota.github.io/), Department of Developmental Psychology and Socialization\n- Prof. [Bruno Scarpa](https://homes.stat.unipd.it/brunoscarpa/), Department of Statistical Sciences\n\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n\n\n::: {layout-ncol=3}\n\n![](files/logo-dpss.bmp){width=\"40%\"}\n\n![](files/logo-stat.png){width=\"50%\"}\n\n![](files/logo-dpg.png){width=\"40%\"}\n\n:::\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# Replicability Crisis in Science\n\n## Overview\n\nWhen evaluating the reliability of scientific findings and predictions, a major concern is about their replicability, that is their consistency across different studies aimed at answering the same question.
